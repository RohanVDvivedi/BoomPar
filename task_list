WORKERS_QUEUE
 * implement worker's queue
 * a wrapper over sync_queue and sync_ll_queue for storing just jobs
 * has functionality for max_capacity is 0, it becomes a sync_ll_queue or else it becomes a sync_queue
 * supports push/pop/close/queue_empty_waiting_thread_count/new/delete/init and deinit functions
 * add a slnode in job as the first attribute to link jobs together

FREELIST
 * implement a freelist implementaton that fallbacks to malloc, and shrinks when necessary, freeing pushes it back to singlylist, maintains counts and can be a global variable, make sure that size of object >= sizeof(slnode) and alignemnt is same as thad of slnode
 * use free list for job structures

* STACK SIZE
 * add parameter for making worker's stack space programmable, 0 takes a default stack space from the OS
 * add parameter for executor's new function for taking in stack_size, keeping it 0, takes default stack_size
 * add a note in tiber to keep stack size of atleast 2KB

* TIBER look for keeping pheap as a structure for the timeouts and sleep of the tibers
 * need tiber_sleep()
 * need tiber_cond_timedwait()
