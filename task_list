PROMISE
 * use this call back to implement get_one, get_all functionality on a pomise sync queue

JOB
 * add WAIT as a job state
 * use linux api of user context to allow separate stacks for jobs

SYNC_STREAM
 * implement sync_stream api, using pthread_spin_lock

EXECUTOR
 * create a job waiters hashtable where they can wait in the executor on sync_stream or a timer
 * wake_one and wake_all calls to wake jobs that are waiting on a sync stream

WORKER
 * reduce the stack size of worker threads saving memory

FUTURE
 * provide smart_pointer
 * yield(time_period_in_nano_seconds) allows a running job to go on a wait, 0 implies a voluntary relinquish of cpu, we will need a job timer heap
