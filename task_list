FIX
 * limit expansion of the sync queue by the max_capacity strictly

JOB feature
 * added a function to clean up the input parameter, this is done immediately after the job is either completed or deinitialized which ever happens first
   * this will help the job to clean up the input parameter even if it does not get executed, for instance on executor shutdown immediately
 * queued state is redundant, discard it

BUG FIX
 * fix race conditon in executor
