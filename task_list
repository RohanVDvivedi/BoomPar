BUG FIX
 *3 add mutex to make shutdown thread safe, use a single boolean variable to check for shutdown, and a condition variable that allows the studown called to wait until all submitters have exited
 *4 build default callbacks to push a promise into a promised queue, upon promise being resolved, and self destruct if the push fails

FEATURE
 * build a generic api for a reference counter that creates an object with reference count 1, and deletes an object if its reference count reaches 0, and has a node based api, allowing to convert any object into a reference counted - shared pointer like pointer
