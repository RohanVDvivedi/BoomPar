 * implement tiber
   * uses ucontext or libucontext underneath
   * uses spinlocked
     * state (TIBER_QUEUED, TIBER_RUNNING, TIBER_WAITING and TIBER_KILLED)
     * ucontext itself
   * takes ucontext lock in parent thread while swapping context
   * has yield_tiber() -> puts current tiber from running to queued state
   * has kill_tiber() -> puts current tiber from running to killed state
   * waits on only a custom condition variable called tiber_cond_t
   * has tiber_cond_signal(tiber_cond_t* tc);
   * and tiber_cond_broadcast(tiber_cond_t* tc);
   * and finally tiber_cond_wait(tiber_cond_t* tc, pthread_mutex_t m);
   * custom execute function that puts the current tiber as its thread local and puts it into running mode takes lock and swaps the context
   * and also a get_new_tiber function that makes a context and gives it to you
