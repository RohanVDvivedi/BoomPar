 * periodic_job
 * a different kind of job, that keeps executing a function as long as until shutdown is called at a fixed intervals in microseconds uint64_t
 * this period can not be BLOCKING or NON_BLOCKING
 * api should support a separate mutex
 * a condition variable to wait on for periodic waits
 * a condition variable to wait on for shutdown
 * a state diagram
 * shutdown function
 * a function to wait for shutdown to complete
 * a function to update the time period_in_microseconds
 * a function to get the current period_in_microseconds
 * a function to execute_periodic_job and execute_periodic_job_async
 * function to pause/play the periodic_job -> setting period to BLOCKING
 * function to run the periodic job immediatly once, if the job is not already running, else this function is a NO-OP, depicting in its return value
 * refactor Bufferpool, MinTxEngine and VolatilePageStore for using this job instead
