FREELIST
 * implement a freelist implementaton that fallbacks to malloc, and shrinks when necessary, freeing pushes it back to singlylist, maintains counts and can be a global variable, make sure that size of object >= sizeof(slnode) and alignemnt is same as thad of slnode
 * use free list for job structures

* STACK SIZE
 * add parameter for making worker's stack space programmable, 0 takes a default stack space from the OS
 * add parameter for executor's new function for taking in stack_size, keeping it 0, takes default stack_size
 * add a note in tiber to keep stack size of atleast 2KB

* SYNC_LL_QUEUE
 * singlylinkedlist based synchronous queue similar to sync_queue but it would not be bounding, and takes in slnode offset
 * push to it's tail and pop from head always
 * use this as job queue for executor and worker

* TIBER look for keeping pheap as a structure for the timeouts and sleep of the tibers
 * need tiber_sleep()
 * need tiber_cond_timedwait()
