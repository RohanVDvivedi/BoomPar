 * check after initialize_* (cutlery calls) and malloc calls, and all get_new functions return NULL or failure but never kill the process

FEATURE
 * build a generic api for a reference counter that creates an object with reference count 1, and deletes an object if its reference count reaches 0, and has a node based api, allowing to convert any object into a reference counted - shared pointer like pointer
 * revamp the executor to use min_worker_count and max_worker_count, and discarding the java's concept for FIXED_THREAD_COUNT_EXECUTOR and CACHED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR
