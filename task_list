SMART_POINTER
 * pointer that deletes what ever it is pointing to after its reference counter reaches 0
 * api like: create_data_value, get_data_value, increment_reference_counter and decrement_reference_counter
 * it stores pointer to synchronous reference counter, pointer to actual value
 * synchronous reference counter stores an unsigned long long int reference counter, pointer to the allocator (cutlery api) and to a pointer to deinitializer function or a pointer to delete function

SYNC_COROUTINE_PIPE
 * implement sync_pipe api

COROUTINE
 * COROUTINE_EXECUTOR - a duplicate of fixed thread count executor but to run only coroutines, it starts all threads at once
 * COROUTINE - a wrapper for functions with void func(void* param)
